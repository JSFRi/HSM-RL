# HSM-RL: Hierarchical Storage Management using Reinforcement Learning

## Introduction

Online data migration policy for Hierarchical Storage System based on Reinforcement Learning. 

In a Hierarchical (Multi-tier) Storage System (HSS), file transfers are controlled by the Data Migration Policy, thus a well-defined policy is crucial for keeping the HSS ordered and well-performed. We use reinforcement learning knowledages to train a continuously-updating (online) migration policy.

## Methods

For each storage tier, we build a RL agent to learn the cost function of this tier, and the migration policy is defined by criterion: *For a file in tier i being requested, it will transferred to tier j if*

For more details about the methods please look at the slides in the supplements.

Folder fast_slow_tier_ansible_client/ contains the code for generating fast/slow tier instance using ansible.

## Codes

Fondamental functions are in the folder Class_func/

'env.py' defines the environments class that used to define the environmental variables of a tier

'agent.py' defines the RL agent class that creates RL agent for a tier

'req_generator.py' defines requests generators that used to generate simulated requested

'RL(/Rule1/Rule2/Rule3)-randinit.py' imply simulations of a system containes three tiers(fast,medium,slow) and 1000 files using policies according to RL agent(/Naive rule1/2/3), for more details please see the slides in supplements.

And the result is shown in the way of Heatmap (see the example below), where each block represent one file and the color of the block means the temperature of the file.
