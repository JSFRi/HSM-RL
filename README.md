# HSM-RL: Hierarchical Storage Management using Reinforcement Learning

## Introduction

Online data migration policy for Hierarchical Storage System based on Reinforcement Learning. 

In a Hierarchical (Multi-tier) Storage System (HSS), file transfers are controlled by the Data Migration Policy, thus a well-defined policy is crucial for keeping the HSS ordered and well-performed. We use reinforcement learning knowledages to train a continuously-updating (online) migration policy
